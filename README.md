# NLP-UniBo
This repository contains three projects developed for a university course in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each project focuses on a distinct aspect of NLP, demonstrating practical applications of state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies.
For each of them a detailed report, other than all the executable files, is available.
